##Details

Data about professional athletes is widely available on the web. For example, consider former professional quarterback Peyton Manning. Do a quick google search for him, and you will quickly find that his personal information and career statistics are distributed across several different websites
* NFL career statistics at [this site](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MannPe00.htm)
* College statistics at [this other site](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/peyton-manning-1.html)
* Personal/Story information at [yet another site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peyton_Manning)

The way that Peyton Manning's data is distributed across the web is common. Most professional athletes' data on the web is organized in a similar manner. This is a problem for data analysts who want to build models to answer sports questions; scraping multiple sites and integrating information is generally not easy. 

In this project, I use R to scrape data on the professional and college careers of NFL running backs. The professional data comes from [here](https://www.pro-football-reference.com/) and the college data comes from [here](https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/). The data was then used to build a model to predict the professional productivity of running backs based on their college statistics.

##My Output

The code and extracted data can be found on [this github repository]()
