## Idea

In this paper, it is shown that on average, initiators of social network friendships directly benefit (in a casual way) from the friendship created (in the form of an increased step count).  On a case by case basis, one might imagine that the magnitude and direction of the friendship effect on the initiators offline activity depends on a variety of factors including :
 
1. The offline relationship between the initiator and receiver of the request
	* Example: Is there on average more benefit to the initiator when the initiator and receiver have more or less mutual connections?
2. The demographic relationship between the initiator and receiver of the request
	* Example: On average, is there more benefit to the initiator when the initiator and receiver are of the same sex, or of opposite sex?

**One project stemming from these questions is the development of a [statistical] model relating the step count increase for the initiator associated with the creation of the friendship to some of the above factors associated with the relationship between the initiator and the receiver of the friendship request. In a broader context, I think this project extrapolates on the authors interest in how online social networks impact offline behavior. In a narrower context, this research could lead to a smart recommendation system for friendship suggestions.**

## Some Next Steps

* Think more about which variables most likely account for individual variation in step count increase associated with friendship creation
* Write down a preliminary [statistical] model!
