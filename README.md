# Basic Information

I just completed an [MS in Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu) at Ohio State University in May of 2019. I graduated from the same university with a [BS in Data Analytics](https://data-analytics.osu.edu) 2 years prior in the spring of 2017. During my time at Ohio State, I conducted research in the [Data Mining Laboratory](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/dmrl/) on applications of semi-supervised learning for disaster relief. I was advised by Professor of Computer Science, [Srinivasan Parthasarathy](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~parthasarathy.2/).

# Interests
I am interesting in Time Series data analysis. By the summer of 2021, I will have a strong applied and theoretical working knowledge in this area. Besides time series, I also study data structures and algorithms, and enjoy problem solving on Leetcode in my spare time.
