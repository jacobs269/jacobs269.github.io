# Basic Information

In late spring 2025 I will be graduating with a PhD in Computing from the Kahlert School of Computing where I am advised by Professor [Jeff Phillips](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~jeffp/). In the last 4 years I have also been an intern at [Sandia National Laboratories] where I have been advised by [Dr. Lekha Patel](https://www.sandia.gov/ccr/staff/lekha-patel/). Prior to my PhD I completed an [MS in Statistics](https://stat.osu.edu) at Ohio State University in May of 2019. While there I conducted research in the Data Mining Research Laboratory on applications of semi-supervised learning for disaster relief with Professor [Srinivasan Parthasarathy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2mjUsP8AAAAJ&hl=en).

# Interests
My research focus is broadly Statistical Machine Learning with specific interest in the development and rigorous analysis of non-parametric statistical methods for challenges present in High Dimensional and/or Time-Dependent data analyses.
