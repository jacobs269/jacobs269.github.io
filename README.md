# Basic Information

I graduated from Ohio State University with a B.S degree in [data analytics](https://data-analytics.osu.edu) in the spring of 2017. I am currently working towards an [M.S. in statistics](https://stat.osu.edu) which I expect to recieve in the spring of 2019. I am applying to PhD programs for enrollement in the fall of 2019. I am a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Honorable Mention](https://stat.osu.edu/news/data-analytics-major-peter-jacobs-honored-national-science-foundation) in [Computational and Data Enabled Science and Engineering](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504813).

# Interests

I am broadly interested in methods for data modeling and visualization. Specific interests include the large scale statistical analysis of massive 21st century datasets to help solve public health problems, as well as human-in-the-loop data modeling (e.g techniques for crowdsourcing in machine learning, and methods for interactive bayesian prior elicitation).
