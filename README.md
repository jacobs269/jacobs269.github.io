# Basic Information

 I am a [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Honorable Mention](https://stat.osu.edu/news/data-analytics-major-peter-jacobs-honored-national-science-foundation) in [Computational and Data Enabled Science and Engineering](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=504813). I am applying to PhD programs for enrollement in the fall of 2019. I am currently working towards an [M.S. in statistics](https://stat.osu.edu) at Ohio State University which I expect to recieve in the spring of 2019. I graduated from Ohio State University with a B.S degree in [data analytics](https://data-analytics.osu.edu) in the spring of 2017.

# Interests

I am broadly interested in methods for data modeling and visualization. Specific interests include the large scale statistical analysis of massive 21st century datasets and human-in-the-loop data modeling (e.g crowdsourcing in machine learning and methods for interactive bayesian prior elicitation).
